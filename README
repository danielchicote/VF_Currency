This module rounds all prices on frontend to integer value or to another precision.
For example, you have the price $304,53. After module installation, you will see on frontend $305.

You can change rounding precision in one constant: Oggetto_Currency_Model_Directory_Currency::PRECISION
Default is 0

Also format has been changed.
Instead of $20 now u will see <span class="currency">$</span><span class="value">20</span>
